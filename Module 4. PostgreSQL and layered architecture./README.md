# PostgreSQL and layered architecture

## PREREQUISITES:

The task is a continuation of [Module 3. In-memory CRUD REST service with validation](https://github.com/ReshetovItsMe/learn-nodejs-hw/tree/main/Module%203.%20In-memory%20CRUD%20REST%20service%20with%20validation.).

## Task 1

* Install DB PostgreSQL on your machine or use a free web hosting services for PostgreSQL (<https://www.heroku.com/postgresor> <https://www.elephantsql.com/plans.html>).

As an alternative to sequelize you can use more low-level query-builder library(<http://knexjs.org/>).
